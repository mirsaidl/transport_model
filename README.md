Multi-Class Object Recognition Model
Welcome to the Multi-Class Object Recognition Model repository! This repository hosts a deep learning model trained to classify images into three categories: airplanes, cars, and boats. The model has been deployed using Streamlit, allowing you to interactively upload images and receive predictions on whether they contain an airplane, a car, or a boat.

Repository Features:
Deep Learning Model: A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of airplanes, cars, and boats to achieve high accuracy in classifying images.

Streamlit Web Application: The model is deployed using Streamlit, providing an intuitive web interface where users can upload their own images and instantly receive predictions.

Educational Resource: This repository serves as an educational resource for understanding image classification using deep learning, with clear documentation and code comments.
